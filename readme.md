My personal sandbox, a rather simple online resume that could easily be a static HTML file.
The simplicity allows me to try out more complex techniques without having to worry about the types of bugs that come form more complex builds.
Technologies/Techniques that I'm using this site to explore include:
* Django
* PostgreSQL
* CI/CD using CircleCI
* Self Hosting on linode using Ubuntu, Nginx, Gunicorn, and LetsEncrypt
